# Tezos_hack
## ABSTRACT
• This project aims at reducing black marketing for covid vaccines by using blockchain technology. So basically, we keep track that for the total vaccine produced to date, surplus stock available with the factory/company and stock available at the vaccination centre.
• In addition, a patient can also get information on the number of slots available for that day for a particular vaccine and information will be visible to all.
## INTRODUCTION
This project greatly decreases any chances of misuse of the vaccine. As Our country is facing a shortage of vaccine due to some unfaithful people who are responsible for lots of innocent deaths So to bring these malpractices to an end becomes our priority. We tried to help our nation by building a website that helps to track all the information of covid vaccine through blockchain technology.
### TECH STACK
• Blockchain
• Tezos
• SmartPy Python Library
• Python Language
• SmartPy IDE
• Web Development
### WORKING
• ### Ordering Vaccine

The user places an order for a particular vaccine from the factory, factory after looking through the available stock, if
the ordered stock is greater than the ordered amount factory calls for transport. Transportation company looks
through the available refrigerator trucks, if the number of refrigerator trucks >=1, the transportation is executed. The
vaccine is then received by the vaccination centre and the respective stocks are updated

• ### Slot Information

The user which is now a patient can check vaccine slot availability with the vaccination centre for a particular vaccine.
The vaccination centre after going through available slots, replies with a number of stocks available for the respective
vaccine.

• ### Updating Stock

The user can also update the available stock with the factory for a particular vaccine by calling the entry_point-
"update_stock" and thus will be updated for the same.

### PROBLEMS OUR PROJECT SOLVED
• It keeps track of the vaccine order from where it is stored, in how much quantity, where it went, and the
quantity at where it went.
• Due absence of any intermediary party and the stock’s track based on blockchain and smart contracts- hacking
or corruption or black marketing is not possible
• User can also directly check from the vaccination centres for the slot availability to avoid any misdirection
regarding this information
• Blockchain Technology - a secured and decentralized technology
### CONCLUSION
The proposed solution is going to help our nation overcome our vaccine shortage problem
by keeping all the information decentralized and available to all. #VaxForAll
